// Given the meal price (base cost of a meal), tip percent (the percentage of the meal price being added as tip), and
// tax percent (the percentage of the meal price being added as tax) for a meal, find and print the meal's total cost.

#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

    cin >> taxPercent; // 5

    tipPercent = (mealCost * (tipPercent/100));

    totalCost = mealCost + tipPercent + taxPercent; // 13
