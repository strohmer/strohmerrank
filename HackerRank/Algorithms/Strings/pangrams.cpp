 * Roy wanted to increase his typing speed for programming contests. So, his
 * friend advised him to type the sentence "The quick brown fox jumps over the
 * lazy dog" repeatedly, because it is a pangram. (Pangrams are sentences
 * constructed by using every letter of the alphabet at least once.)
 * After typing the sentence several times, Roy became bored with it.
 * So he started to look for other pangrams.
 * Given a sentence s, tell Roy if it is a pangram or not.
